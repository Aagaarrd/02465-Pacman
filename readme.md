# Project for 02465 - Introduction to reinforcement learning and control

## Working with virtual environments (venv)
The project framework is written in Python2 which is soon to be unsupported (yay) - to get it to run on our machines running Python3 as the systems interpreter we use virtual environments which contains an isolated installation of Python and pip.

PyCharm should find the venv by itself, so no worries there.

To activate the venv in a terminal open the project directory in PowerShell as an administrator and write out `bin/activate.ps1`.
